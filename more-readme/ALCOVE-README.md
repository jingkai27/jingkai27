* Music streaming is everywhere, but meaningful engagement is lacking.
* Gen Z & Gen Alpha crave authentic self-expression and community.
* Current platforms offer passive listening and generic sharing.
* Music is deeply personal, yet users can't showcase their identity creatively.
* Lack of personalized profiles, social layers, and emotional resonance.

Despite widespread use, streaming apps fall short on creativity, connection, and community.

**Problem Statement:**

How might we transform music streaming into a canvas for self-expression, where users can creatively showcase their identity and taste?
